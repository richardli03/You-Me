_Dear Danny,_

_I hope this letter finds you well. I felt like you were really mad at me yesterday, but I didn’t get a chance to talk to you about it at all. I’d like to meet with you if that’s alright, but since I don’t know if you’ll respond, I suppose I’ll write down some thoughts here._

----------------------------------------------------

Danny trudged out of his 300-student biology class, utterly exhausted by the test he had just taken. Chapter 11 was notoriously hard, but this year the professor, Dr.Harvey, seemed to have a special vendetta against his kids. Shouldering his bag, he began to discuss the test with his friends, blatantly ignoring the order they had just been given. I mean, the professor didn’t _really_ expect anybody to follow it, right? He had considered transferring out before, but since Dr.Harvey monopolized the biology division at Danny’s school, there wasn’t _really _the option of another class. But if he was going to give ridiculously hard tests, the least he could do was let Danny and the other victims suffer together.

They parted ways at the library as Danny mentally prepared himself to finish his english project due on Monday. It was his 21st birthday tonight, and his friends insisted on getting him at least a _little_ drunk. Productivity was sure to be negative over the weekend. After he grabbed a cup of tea at the café, Danny walked to the individual studying tables, sat down and spread his project across it. Then, he pulled out his headphones and began to settle in.

A few minutes into his session a girl entered the room and sat down to his left. Suddenly, Danny was pulled from his studying stupor. She smelled like heaven. The aroma of vanilla and honey flooded his senses.  

_That’s so creepy,_ Danny scolded himself as he tried to refocus. But that smell. The exotic sweetness was so utterly distracting. He allowed himself a glance to the left and saw that she was opening up biology notes. Since his college had so many students, he, as a second-semester junior, still didn’t recognize everyone. He had definitely never seen her before. She began to twirl a pencil in her fingers as she focused. Danny noticed it said ‘Chapter 11’ at the top. _Ah_.

“That test was really hard,” Danny said involuntarily. He regretted it immediately and looked down with embarrassment. “I just took it.” The girl turned to look at Danny. Danny blinked. Her eyes were the softest possible blue, and he tried his best not to look like he had just forgotten how to speak.

“Was it? I’m so screwed,” She said with worry. “I missed last class because I was sick and Harvey cancelled his office hours today.” Danny immediately saw an opportunity, and before his better sense could react, he took it.

“Oh? I can help,” Danny offered, then quickly adding “... if you’d like, of course.” He tried to look casual, but guessed that he was probably failing miserably. Thankfully, she seemed a little too flustered to notice.

“That’d be awesome. My name’s Adelynn, by the way. What about you?”

“Daniel, but everyone calls me Danny.”



Danny spent the rest of that afternoon helping her through the concepts of Chapter 11... kind of. She was a fast learner and grasped the concepts really quickly, so he taught her what she needed to know and spent the rest of the time conversing with her while working on his project. They exchanged numbers as Danny wished her luck on her test. Adelynn flashed a smile and thanked him before leaving. Danny swallowed. _Holy shit._

----------------------------------------------------

Danny was _not_ ready to party. His friends, like the utter psychopaths they were, chose to take Danny to Eclipse, the most popular bar in the area. They said something about ‘needing the true 21st birthday experience.’ Danny could understand the thought process. Eclipse was right next to the college and had been facilitating bad decisions for the past 20 years, so it was almost seen as a “rite of passage” to get trashed there.

As soon as he walked through the doors, he knew he was _fucked_. “Crowded” didn’t even begin to describe the wriggling mass of bodies that blockaded every pathway in the bar. Friday night had clearly not been the smartest time to come. Danny and his friends slowly made their way to an empty booth his friends had reserved for him.

_There is no way in hell we’re supposed to fit all 12 of us here_, Danny thought to himself. Almost immediately afterward, all 12 people squeezed into the booth shouting something about “drinks for the table”.

Danny wasn’t a stranger to alcohol. He had done his fair share of underage drinking at high school parties and whatnot. He simply hadn’t indulged quite as much as some of his more… _eccentric_ friends.

Before he could even wrap his head around how they were managing to squeeze 12  people on a couch meant for 6, he realized that his friends had moved on to bigger and better plans: getting him a girl. No place like a sweaty bar to find true love, right? In an attempt to distract the mob, Danny raised his bottle and they began to drink. Minutes turned into hours as the stack of empty bottles piled higher and higher on the table. He thought the alcohol would make his friends forget their plans, but the opposite occurred; they couldn’t seem to talk about anything else. Now sufficiently intoxicated, they pushed him out of the booth, once again pressuring him to find a companion.

Then, out of the corner of his eye, he spotted _her._ Adelynn was here! The visible jerking of his head as he turned to her made the rest of his friends stop. A few of them followed his eyes and laughed. They all collectively shoved Danny in that direction. _Well, here goes nothing._


## Play: 24/7

Turns out, she was conveniently there for a friend’s birthday party. His friends nodded their approval as he left with her. _Score!_

The rest of the night was a blur. They had walked back to the university and snuck onto the roof of his dorm building, staring at the stars. Danny let himself slowly become enveloped by that same sweet smell — vanilla and honey. The sunset slowly turned into a sunrise, and Danny was glad he wouldn’t have to wake up early the next day. There was a chill in the early March air, so they had stopped by Danny’s room to grab a blanket and his beanbag chair. Now, they reclined on the beanbag as they hugged each other to stay warm. Her brown locks of hair contrasted neatly with the white button up Danny had worn that day. He sat there, twisting her hair with his finger when a thought suddenly penetrated his mind.

_This is too good to be true._

The words felt like they were imprinted on the inside of his skull, and he couldn’t erase it no matter how hard he tried. He closed his eyes for a second and willed himself to think about something else. Anything else. He settled on the aroma around him.

Adelynn told him about her test (she felt like she did fine, naturally) and they laughed together about Professor Harvey’s _bullshit_ test curve. As they silently sobered up and watched the streaks of red and orange dissolve into the sky, Adelynn suddenly spoke.

“Do you think God is real?”

The question stumped Danny. He’d never been a big believer of any supernatural cosmic forces — he always thought that that mentality would make him weak. In his mind, he had worked for everything he earned, but this night was making him doubt. On a campus with over a thousand students, most of whom he’d never seen in his three years of college, he just ran into the same person twice in the same day entirely accidentally.

“I… I guess I don’t know,” Danny stumbled. She turned to him with a quizzical look in her eye.

“I do,” she said with conviction, “I think somebody is looking out for me.”

“So... you believe in God?”

“Yeah.” Adelynn said with a conviction that confused Danny. He twirled Adelynn’s hair with his index finger as he tried to compose his next thought. Her hair smelling like exotic spices and the conversation making him question his existence definitely didn’t help his situation.

“Isn’t that scary? I feel like having my life controlled by an outside force isn’t what I’d want.”

“Well… I believe God always has your best interests at heart. And I don’t know what the plan is for me, so I guess it’s more comforting if anything… knowing that there’s an all-powerful being out there pushing you to fulfill your purpose.”

Danny closed his eyes. “This is a lot to take in.”

	“Well then,” Adelynn laughed, “let’s go back to talking about the more important stuff. Do you think Harvey is a secret serial killer or not?” Danny cracked up.

It was really too perfect. Absurdly, unrealistically perfect. This girl was laughing at his nonsensical jokes and leaning on his chest in just the right way to force the butterflies into his stomach.  They conversed a little more before heading back to their respective dormitories. Before they left, they agreed: this would not be the last time they saw each other.
