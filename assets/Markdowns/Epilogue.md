Danny looked around his room. His entire college life was packed away in a mountain of suitcases and boxes, and he was ready to load it onto his car. He had already established living arrangements for the next year, so he was excited to finally be done with this place.

He did one last sweep of the entire room, crouching under tables and reaching behind corners to make sure he hadn’t missed anything. He pulled open the drawer next to his bed, and felt around. His fingers grazed what felt like a few slips of paper. Curious, he grabbed it and pulled it out.

_You are my favorite person in the whole wide world_.

Danny’s face slowly morphed into a sad smile. A few bittersweet memories flitted through his head, but before they could really grab ahold of him, he crumpled up the paper and tossed it into one of the communal trash cans in the hallway.

Adelynn had accepted a job offer halfway across the country. Danny would probably never see her again.

_No more you and me,_ Danny thought. _You. Me. Separate.  _

_	_And that was good enough for him.
