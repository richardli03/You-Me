_… but somehow I always felt like something wasn’t right._

--------------------------

Danny reclined on his bed while he video-called with Addie. The clock beside him slowly ticked past 10 PM.

“So… you’re not coming over?” Danny asked. Addie fidgeted with her necklace. She was wearing a figure-hugging dress, and despite how tense the situation was, she still looked stunning.

“Danny… no, I can’t. My friends are coming in 30 minutes,” she said, “my Wednesday nights are not yours alone.”

Danny’s confusion quickly bubbled into frustration. “That’s not what I’m saying,” Danny elaborated, careful to keep his tone from entering ‘whiny’ territory, “it’s just... you spent the last month coming over every Wednesday, so it’s confusing when you don’t. I had this whole thing planned out and—”

“But did I say I’d come every Wednesday?”

“No but —”

“But I didn’t say every Wednesday, so I’m not obligated to come.” Her voice was firm. Unfeeling. In the background, Danny heard Addie’s friends laughing as they did their makeup together. “Listen Danny, I’m sorry if you misunderstood. I’ve got to go.”

The call ended. Danny, frustrated,  ran his fingers through his hair. After a minute, he sighed and tossed the bag of popcorn on his table into the trash. He sat down at his desk and pulled out the homework he was going to avoid.

Right on cue, the thoughts made their way into his head.

_See, you’re completely unlovable. Why would she sacrifice for you?_


  --------------------------

_It was the constant disagreements._

--------------------------

Danny and Addie were sitting together in the piano room. Danny was fiddling around on the keys, not really paying attention to what he was playing. Addie was scrolling through her phone. She suddenly gasped.

“Oh my… there’s this story about a little kid who lost both of his parents in a missile strike. What is our government doing?” Addie asked, clearly distraught. Danny looked over with concern and read the story quickly.

“I’m gonna be honest. Stuff like this makes it hard for me to believe in God.” Addie turned to face him, a lecture written all over her face. “I know, I know. We read it together. Job… ‘Shall we receive good and not evil?’ … but still. This doesn’t make any sense.”

Addie didn’t bother to contest. She simply said “God’s ways are higher than ours.” Hearing this, a little flame lit itself in Danny’s stomach.

_Say it._

He shook his head. Like a little parasitic worm, those words invaded his skull.

_Say it_.

“You can’t seriously believe that.” Danny said, shutting the lid over the keys. “God is _traumatizing_ a kid. It can’t be worth it.”

“Maybe this moment will be instrumental in what the kid does in the fu—” she started, then cut herself off. “You know what? I’m not going to try to convince you. If you think you know better than God, then challenge him on it. Pray.”

“Wait, Addie. I didn’t mean to—”

“You act like you believe in him, and then every time something’s wrong, you doubt and complain.” With that, Addie opened the floodgates. In his head, he could feel the thoughts creeping in.

_She’s so delusional. She’s a fanatic!_

Danny tried to stop himself from opening his mouth, but the thoughts were being drilled into his head, and before he could think he had begun the fireworks.

“Hey. That’s not fair. You can’t possibly be calling me out for doubting and complaining. That’s so hypocritical.”

“I definitely don’t do it as much as you. You always need a 30 minute lecture in order to get your faith back in line. Do you believe, or not?”

Danny shook his head in disbelief “Wow, I didn’t know that _quantity of complaining _was what determined whether or not you’re a good Christian. Good to know _you’re_ the second coming of Jesus, Addie.”

Addie stood up, clearly furious. “I don’t know why you always drag God into these conversations. It’s like you want to fight with me,” she said, and then added, “I don’t care. Just read the Bible.”

“I’ll do it as soon as you stop with the holier-than-thou bullshit.” Addie glared. Danny realized he might’ve taken a step too far.

“Fine.” She huffed off and slammed the door behind her. Danny was too angry to go after her.

--------------------------

_The constant fighting ._

--------------------------

“What are you thinking for dinner?” Danny asked, pushing his phone out so Addie could see their options. It was chilly outside, and she was snuggled in tight on his chest. It was a Sunday afternoon, and they had just finished their Bible study session.

“Mmm, I don’t know—”

“Don’t say ‘you choose,’ or I swear I’ll lose my mind.” Danny interrupted, a smile creeping onto his face.

“You…”

“Don’t...”

“Choose. You choose!” Danny buried his head into his hands as Addie giggled.

“Well, Andrew recommended this burrito place downtown. We could get delivery in…” Danny scrolled down his phone and found the place. “Twenty minutes.” He leaned forward to see Addie’s expression.

“Wait. Andrew? You still talk to Andrew?” She asked as though she was accusing Danny of a crime. Danny sighed.

“Yeah. He’s my friend.”

“Didn’t I tell you that you should cut him off? He literally only talks shit about everyone he knows to you. What do you think he tells other people about you?” Addie sat up now, looking at Danny. “Every time you’re done talking to him, you’re… sadder.”

Danny groaned. “Ho-ly Addie. It’s fine. He’s recommending us to a restaurant, not giving me therapy.”

Addie’s eyes gained a look of disappointment. “Seriously, Danny. You shouldn’t be friends with him.”

Danny tried to stay calm. “Listen, Addie. I don’t ask you to cut off Meg or Jennifer even though they’re not really the best of friends to you. Don’t try to control who I hang out with.” He hoped she could tell that this was the moment to back off, but instead she looked more intent to finish the conversation.

“What’s wrong with Meg and Jen?”

“Ah, nevermind. Can we just order food please?”

“No, no. I want to know!” She said firmly as she pushed Danny’s phone down. Danny groaned and tried to phrase his thoughts in the most innocuous way possible.

“I… I just think that sometimes they push you to do stuff that isn’t good for you.”

“Oh?” Addie immediately responded “And you’re suddenly the authority on what’s good and bad for me? Holy shit Danny, I can’t believe …” Danny leaned backwards as he prepared himself for the lecture that was coming next. As per usual, the little parasitic words started drilling themselves into his head.

_How come she can say that to you, but you can’t say it back? She’s honestly so insane._



--------------------------

_Honestly I felt like I was slowly becoming someone you needed, not someone you loved._

--------------------------

Danny and Addie were laying next to each other on Danny’s bed. Danny’s laptop was illuminating his face with a soft blue tint as he typed out his essay. Beside him, Addie was reading a book by lamplight. All things considered, Danny had really no reason to feel uncomfortable. At that moment, he felt the words making their way into his mind.

_She doesn’t love you_.

Danny shook his head. He had been considering talking to someone about this sensation in his head. He had prayed about it, but God was, as usual, silent. It had been many many months now, and these intrusive thoughts had only been getting worse.

_She doesn’t love you_.

Normally, he was able to ignore the words. It was painful, but if he didn’t focus on it, it wouldn’t impede his life. After all, Addie certainly loved him. They kissed, danced together… she liked the same music as him, she made him feel happy, it was perfect!

_She doesn’t love you_.

Like an army marching forward, this time the words deepened their impression. There was no logic, no reasoning to this repetition, but Danny could feel his forehead heating up.

“Hey, are we okay?” Danny asked, out of the blue. Addie sat up, concerned.

“What do you mean?’

“I mean… us. Are we okay? Do you…” Danny swallowed. He knew this question was a stupid question to ask, but his mouth said the words before he could stop himself. “... love me?”

Danny could tell that Addie was resisting to roll her eyes into the back of her skull. This wasn’t the first time he’d asked a question like this. Whenever he felt the writing on his skull, he had to say something about it. It was an itch he couldn’t avoid scratching. Normally, Addie would just say ‘no’ sarcastically, or kiss him and say ‘does that confirm things?’ This time, however, her face was far more serious.

“I feel like I’ve told you before that I hate this question. Why do you need to ask?” Addie spoke deliberately, as if she was asking Danny to plan his next words carefully. Danny’s cheeks suddenly grew warm from embarrassment. After a moment of thought, he began.

“I—”

“Actually, I don’t really want to hear it. Just go back to your work.” Danny, embarrassed, nodded and looked down at his keyboard. Maybe if he looked pitiable, she’d pity him. He didn’t want to tell her about the words; she really didn’t need to think he was insecure _and_ crazy. Instead of comforting him, she turned further away from him, reading her book fully on her side now. Danny wanted to smack himself in the head, but all the same he wondered why she couldn’t just say “yes” and be done with it. He moved to go back to his work, but he couldn’t stay focused. Addie’s silent frustration was radiating from her like she was a ticking grenade. Danny _had_ to try and defuse it.

“Addie… are you alright?” Danny eventually caved. She turned around, and Danny could see that her eyes were rimmed slightly red. “I… I’m sorry.”

At this, Addie blew up. “Are you though? Are you really? You say you’re sorry every time you do something like this and then ask again the next month. You’re manipulating me, Danny. You’re manipulating me for your own fucking self-esteem and I hate it.” Addie stood up and left, slamming the door behind her.

Danny sat on his bed, utterly speechless.

_I can’t believe you ever loved her. She obviously never loved you_.
