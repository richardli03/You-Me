--------------------------

_Well, my offer to talk still stands. I’ll be waiting in the room at 9. I hope to see you._

_Yours,_

_Adelynn_

--------------------------

Daniel choked back a bitter laugh as he put the letter back in the envelope. _Yours_. He didn’t know if the irony was intentional, but it certainly cut deep.



A few minutes before 9, Daniel entered the room. It felt foreign. He had memories of hanging up the string lights, the posters and dusting everything, but now it felt like somebody else did it. He sat at the piano bench and brushed his fingertips across the keys. He played the middle C. The sound was jarring, as though Daniel was just now realizing it was an old and decrepit piano.

“Hey,” came a voice from behind. Daniel turned around. Adelynn had snuck up on him. She still looked as stunning as ever. Notably absent, however, was the smell of vanilla and honey. There was a faint hint of citrus, but none of the scent Daniel was familiar with.

“Hi,” Daniel responded awkwardly. He scooted over and she sat next to him on the piano bench. A few butterflies fluttered hopelessly in his stomach. “How… how are you?”

“Good. And you?”

“I’m alright.”

The conversation puttered out instantly. Daniel stared at the piano keys, unwilling to look Adelynn in the face. What was there to say? Why did he come here anyways?

“You know, I’m surprised you showed up today,” Adelynn said, finally. Her fingers were splayed on the bench, and it took all of Daniel’s self control not to reach over and lace his with hers.

“Why’s that?” He asked

“Well, I just thought you hated me after last night. Sorry for being cold, by the way.” Daniel looked up into Adelynn’s eyes and saw that the hazel specks seemed to have taken up more of her eyes. It was like a layer of leaves was covering the sky blue underneath.

“No, no. It should be me. I should be apologizing. I did it first—” he was going to continue blaming himself, but Adelynn cut him off.

“But I did it second. It doesn’t make it less wrong,” she said as she twirled her hair nervously. “I suppose I was just hurt. You made it sound like I didn’t care.”

“That’s what I thought. You were with Will literally two weeks after we were done.” Adelynn’s shocked expression didn’t deter him. “You guys went to the café, and I live there. You know that.” She nodded, defeated. He didn’t talk about hearing them in this room, but something about Adelynn’s expression made him feel like she already knew.

“That was a little dumb. I’m sorry I hurt you.” She paused. “I think Will just came into my life at the right time,” she looked and saw that Daniel was about to speak and preemptively said “and I feel more… secure with him.” Daniel didn’t let his facial expressions betray an ounce of hurt, even though he felt like his insides were being boiled alive.

“Secure?” Daniel asked tentatively.

“Well, Will and I don’t fight all the time about what we do and when we do it. We both make time for each other, but understand if plans don’t work out… it just felt… right?” She came tumbling to a stop, and Daniel stared at her while her sentence sort of puttered out.

Finally, he sighed. “I guess I just don’t get it.” Adelynn tilted her head questioningly. “I thought when you were talking about God and fate and stuff like that…” he paused, trying to regain his composure. “I actually bought into it. But you were… joking? I guess?”

Adelynn brought her hands to the keyboard and copied Daniel’s tapping. “I wasn’t. I just don’t think it was meant to be what you wanted it to be.”

“You told me God was in control.”

“_He_ is. Not you.” Daniel took a moment to digest what she meant. “At some point, you’re going to have to learn that it’s not about you.”

“I…” Danny wanted to argue, but how could he? Here he was, obviously _not_ in control. He spent this entire relationship trying to get things under control. The way he felt. The way she felt. The way their relationship worked… It was too good to be true so he strangled it until it wasn’t true anymore. In the end, he had nobody to blame but himself. “I’m sorry.” Adelynn looked confused, so he expanded. “I’m sorry that I did… everything that I did. You deserve better.”

She looked like she was considering her words very carefully. “Listen… what I want out of a relationship… you can’t give me that.” She leaned over and took his hand. “And I can’t give you what you want. It’s not your fault. I love you. I just don’t… _love_ you.” Danny let that register. It hurt.

Daniel swallowed. Hard. “I guess I’ve learned a lot from… this.” He gestured between the two of them with his hands. His vision got a little blurry as he tried not to think about what ‘this’ could’ve been. He grinded his teeth, but squeezed out a few more words. “So, I suppose I should be saying thank you. And thanks to _Him_” he pointed upwards and she smiled.  

Adelynn looked down and blinked a few times. Daniel couldn’t tell if she was crying or not. “Well, I’ve got to go. I have something scheduled at 9:30. It was nice seeing you.”

Daniel paused, and thought for a few seconds before he spoke again. “Nice seeing you too, Addie.” Her eyes brightened a little bit, hearing that name. As she opened the door to leave, he added “and, for the record… I’m happy for you.” He wasn’t sure if he meant it yet, but it felt right to say.

Addie smiled. “Thanks Danny.”

Danny watched as she left. When the door swung shut, he felt a sudden ache in his stomach as the last of the butterflies died. After a few minutes, he stood up and walked out as well.  Before he left, he turned around and took one last look into the room. Memories tried to flood into his head, but he flicked a button and turned the string lights off. The room was drenched in darkness. He gently closed the door behind him and started walking downstairs.

_Play: Butterflies (SECRET BONUS SONG -- Youtube Only)_

A few weeks later, it was Danny’s 22nd birthday, and his friends surprised him, dragging him out of his dorm and into a car en route to Eclipse. He had initially resisted since he only had bad memories of the place, but his friends told him it was an 80s night, and he wasn’t going to miss that for the world. Internally, Danny wondered if Adelynn would be there again, since she was there for her friend’s birthday party last time.

Lo and behold, no more than 20 minutes into the night, he saw her. She was with her whole friend group, conversing and laughing, but every once in a while her eyes would dart to him. It was clearly a girl’s night out, and Will was nowhere to be seen. He stood and walked over to the DJ’s table and wrote down a song request. The night passed surprisingly quickly. Danny was in paradise, dancing to 80s songs with his friends. Tonight was inconsequential. Danny let himself relax. Before he knew it, the DJ was rounding everyone up for the last song.

“Guys, it’s been a pleasure doing 80s night with you—” he was interrupted with a wall of cheers. “—and here’s the last song, party hard guys!”

It was Danny’s request.

Play: Villain

Throughout the entire song, Danny sat and bopped along with his friends, pretending to pay attention to the drinking game they were playing to finish the drinks they bought. But instead, he kept sneaking glances at Addie. It seemed like she was doing the same thing. Danny hoped she understood the message.

The night wrapped up smoothly, and before he knew it, he found himself in his dorm room, slightly tipsy but generally in high spirits. He checked the clock. Quarter past two. He jumped into the shower, humming to himself.

He felt… peculiar. Like there was a roaring fire in his stomach, but ice on his skin. He stepped out of the shower, praying that he didn’t have a fever. That would put a damper on his mood. Everytime he breathed in, he felt like there was an emptiness threatening to swallow him from the inside.

_See, she doesn’t love you. I win._

The words reverberated in Danny’s skull.

_You’re not happy,_

He closed his eyes and felt these words being carved into his forehead

_and you don’t deserve to be happy._

Agony

Danny took a deep breath. “What the fuck do you want from me?” Danny lashed out at the wall in his room.

_I win._

Danny gritted his teeth. It couldn’t go on like this. Every happy moment of this past year, every ray of sunshine, greyed out by these stupid words. Danny didn’t even believe them.

Or did he?

Was he truly unloveable? Truly undeserving of happiness? He leaned against and slid down the wall. Honestly, he… didn’t know.
