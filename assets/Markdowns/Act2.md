_Do you remember how it was in the beginning?_

--------------------------

Danny woke up the next day thoroughly distracted. He was very lucky he had planned absolutely nothing for the day —although, to be fair, he thought the thing crippling him would be alcohol, not… _this_. Honestly, he didn’t even know what _this_ was. He did, however, intend to find out.

Danny tossed his umbrella from hand to hand as he arrived at the library a few minutes before he had arranged to meet Adelynn for coffee. The morning sun was hidden underneath clouds, and the gloomy day promised rain, but Danny was entirely unconcerned. He still felt a vague euphoria from last night, and that made him impervious to the world around him. He walked to the café and sat down at a table.

Vanilla and honey.

The smell heralded her entrance like trumpeters before a king. Instantly, Danny felt like melting into his shoes as he turned around as casually as possible. There she was, sporting a black crop top and high-waisted jeans. The outfit wasn’t supposed to stand out, but Danny couldn’t look away. He waved to catch Adelynn’s attention and she nodded in his direction. After she got her drink, (_green tea_, Danny noted) she walked over to Danny’s table.

“Hey, how are you?” Adelynn asked as she sat down.

“I’m doing fantastic, and you?” Adelynn nodded in response as she sipped her tea. They took a moment of silence as both of them tried to evaluate the situation. Thankfully, Danny had planned for this.

“Come with me. I want to show you something,” Danny said with bottled excitement. Adelynn curiously followed as Danny took her to the elevator.

--------------------------

_I remember the first time you showed me that little piano room tucked away in the top floor of the library _

--------------------------

“This is my favorite room on campus.” Danny had taken Adelynn up to the seventh floor of the library hall. The library used to have practice rooms above it for musicians before the music hall was built. Now, the seventh floor was a storage floor, with dusty cases and books lying around everywhere. The elevator didn’t even reach it; people who wanted to get to the 7th floor had to first ride to the 6th floor and then take the stairs up to the 7th. Students would occasionally come up here to find old textbooks to pass off as their own or borrow instruments.

Danny had, while exploring the library in his freshman year, found a small practice room tucked behind a few string bases. Inside, there was a piano bench and a lonely, slightly out-of-tune piano facing a dusty window.

Over the years, this room had turned into a pseudo-sanctuary for him. He would come up with a cup of tea from the café and play a few notes on the piano while looking off into the distance. It was his little slice of campus that nobody else knew about. Until now.

“Oh! How adorable,” Adelynn gushed as she stepped into the room.

“Do you like it?” Danny sat down and tapped on the piano, eliciting an out-of-tune warble.

“I don’t know, play something for me and I might be able to make a decision,” Adelynn gave Danny a smile before sitting next to him on the bench.

“Well, what do you want me to play?” Danny asked, curious.

Adelynn pondered for a moment. “Mmm, I don’t know. Your favorite song?”

Danny nodded; he barely got through the first three chords of “Uptown Girl” before Adelynn laughed out loud. “I love Billy Joel!”

“Seriously?” Danny turned in disbelief.

“Yeah!” Adelynn began to belt out the words. Danny joined in mid chorus and they sang it as a duet all the way through. As the song wound down, Danny stared at Adelynn, who was sitting, eyes closed, enjoying Danny’s impromptu outro.

“I had no idea you could sing like that.” Danny said, incredulous.

“I took choir in highschool. Mother’s orders.” Adelynn tapped on the keys. “Never learned piano though; I’ve always wanted to.”

“I could probably teach you,” Danny said without hesitation, “piano’s not that hard.”

Adelynn laughed. “I’m not surprised that a piano prodigy like you would say that, Danny.” Danny smiled as well.

Something suddenly crossed Danny’s mind. “Does anybody call you Addie?”

“Not that I know of, why?”

“I don’t know… I think it’s a cute name,” Danny said sheepishly.

Adelynn laughed out loud “Well, if you like it, you can call me that.”

“Addie.” Danny said with a smile.

Addie spoke again. “Oo! What about Sinatra? Do you listen to him?” Danny feigned offense.

“Why, of course I do. Who doesn’t know Sinatra?” Danny started playing “Fly Me To the Moon,” and Addie audibly sighed in satisfaction.

After they sang the song, they sat together, content. As he had predicted, the grey clouds had released a light drizzle onto the campus. Danny felt the question being pulled to his lips and just allowed it to escape.

“So… what are we?” Addie turned away from the window and looked him in the eyes.

“What do you want us to be?” she said, with faux curiosity. Silence blanketed the room.  The light from the window seemed to reflect off every surface of the room, projecting shimmering rays everywhere. Simultaneously, they both leaned in. Out of the corner of his eyes, he could spot their shadow against the wall as their lips touched. _Euphoria_.

--------------------------

Danny laid back on his bed after taking a long, warm shower. After he walked Addie back to her room, he had the incredibly dumb idea to take a page out of “Singing in the Rain” and close his umbrella. The light drizzle had transformed into a gusty spring storm and within minutes he was drenched from head to toe.

To be fair, he didn’t feel cold at all until he stumbled into his dorm building. The few people sitting in the lobby gave him weird glances.

“Rough day?” one of them asked with concern.

“Not even a little bit,” Danny smiled and said as he hummed a vaguely jovial tune while hopping up the stairs, shivering.

Now as he was staring at the ceiling, freshly showered and thoroughly warmed up, his mind began to wander. First it was to all of the places he wanted to take Addie, then it was to all of the songs he couldn’t wait to sing with her, and finally he just started to think about Addie in general. Everything spiralled and spiralled until it settled down on just one thought:

_Danny, this was way too easy. She can’t be serious._

That was that thought that had invaded his head after they left Eclipse. Now, it was here again the second he got a chance to think. Try as he might to remove it, the thought stuck to his brain like a spitball to a wall.

“Maybe she just likes me.” He muttered, he wasn’t too sure who he was saying this to. These thoughts seemed almost involuntary.

_Who in their right mind would like you? _



--------------------------

_ Do you remember that awesome storm?_

--------------------------

Danny was buried into a book when the downpour started. It was sudden, torrential, and entirely uncalled for. It was as if God opened up the heavens and started pouring out all of the water in reserve. Danny, with his headphones blasting music, didn’t hear anything until his phone paused his music for him to give him a notification:

_Hi. I’m outside._

Danny looked outside and his eyes widened. He paused his music, grabbed an umbrella and immediately sprinted down to the front door. Addie was _drenched_.

“Holy shit Addie, why didn’t you come upstairs? My parents would’ve totally let you in.”

“It’s nice out here. Come join me!” Danny took one look outside and immediately raised a critical eyebrow. Addie, seeing the disapproval, tried again, “oh come on, it’s boring to be dry all the time.” Before he could say yes or no, Addie had disappeared into the rain. _I’m going to regret this_, Danny thought before he left his umbrella by the door and went outside.

As soon as he exited his house, he realized that his umbrella would’ve been entirely useless anyway. The wind was sending the rain down at a 45 degree angle, drenching him head to toe almost instantly. He looked around but couldn’t see Addie through the sheets of rain.

“Addie?” He called out. Suddenly a pair of hands clutched his shoulders

“_Boo!_” Addie screeched. Danny started and turned around.

“Oh you _little shi—”_ Danny cut himself off as he began to chase Addie around. They ran to the park next to Danny’s house, when Addie suddenly slipped on a muddy patch of grass. Danny tried to stop himself, but tripped over Addie as they both tumbled to the ground. Addie was laughing so hard she was struggling to catch her breath. Danny sat up with his arms crossed, trying to pretend like he was angry, and his right earbud fell out of his ear onto Addie’s outstretched arm.

“Oo! What’re you listening to?” She asked as she put it in her ear. Danny pressed play, and Addie immediately began to dramatically headbang. “This gives me an idea,” she said as she grabbed Danny’s hands and began to dance. Seeing such unadulterated joy on her face, Danny couldn’t help but join in.


## Play: Summer Rain

--------------------------

_Or the first time we went to church?_

--------------------------

It was a bright summer morning. Danny looked in the mirror, holding two outfits in front of himself. Addie was looking from across the room, sprawled across his bed. Addie sighed and stretched. Addie and Danny both lived in the university’s vicinity, so, although it was summer vacation, they met up all the time to grab coffee or see a movie. But when Addie excitedly asked if he wanted to go to her family church, he didn’t want to dampen her spirits and say no. Now, here he was, holding two different uncomfortably formal outfits.

“Are you _still_ trying to choose your outfit? Can we hurry it up? It’s church, not a supermodel showcase.”

“I’m not trying to look out of place,” Danny insisted unapologetically “plus, you do this all the time. It’s my turn.” He turned towards her and asked, “Now, button-up shirt or sweater?” He held up the two options.

“I mean, it usually doesn’t take me this long to decide,” Addie said as she sat up. “And are you serious? Obviously a button-up. It’s the middle of July. Are you trying to die from heat stroke?”

“Well, first of all, you’re lying,” Addie raised an eyebrow. “Secondly, you look good in everything” Addie rolled her eyes and began to form the word ‘shush’ in her mouth, but Danny continued, “and, thirdly, as you would say, ‘_beauty is pain_’. A little heat stroke never hurt anyone.” Addie laughed as she pushed the button-up towards him.

“Just put on the damn button-up, Danny.”

--------------------------

Entering the church was odd. It was Addie’s family church, so she was greeting and conversing with everyone they met. Danny felt like a little puppy, completely oblivious as Addie introduced him to everyone and everyone to him. Eventually, after what felt like a million years, they got inside and sat down on a pew in the far corner of the sanctuary. He had insisted that they sit as far away from the speaker as possible to avoid potentially being singled out. Addie rolled her eyes, but decided that she had pushed Danny outside of his comfort zone enough.

The pastor was talking about the book of Job. Or at least, he was when Danny was paying attention. Without him even realizing it, he completely zoned out until Addie elbowed him.

“Danny, are you awake?” Addie whispered as she flipped to the next page of her notebook. _She’s taking notes?_

“What? Yeah, I am.” Danny shook himself out of his stupor.

“Why is your Bible still open to Job then?”

“Isn’t that what we were talking about?”

“Yeah, like 25 minutes ago!” Addie whispered forcefully. Danny’s eyes betrayed his shock. Addie rolled her eyes and returned to her notebook.

Later that night, Danny went over to Addie’s dorm and knocked. After a few minutes of conversation, he brought up what he wanted to say.

“Hey Addie. I’m sorry.”  Danny said, sheepishly.

“About what?” she replied in a way that indicated that she knew _exactly_ what he was apologizing about.

“About zoning out today.” Addie looked Danny dead in the eyes, brows furrowed, and he braced himself for the earful that he was about to receive. All of a sudden, she started laughing.

“It’s okay. It’s okay,” she said in between giggles, “sermons can be boring.” Danny breathed a sigh of relief.

“I just don’t get it. I think the stories are interesting, but these hour-long sermons just make me want to lose my mind.” Danny put his hands out in a show of utter helplessness. Addie paused and tapped her finger against her chin.

“You know what,” Addie said after a few seconds, “I think we can just read it together.” Danny’s eyes brightened up.

“Seriously?”

“Yeah. I’ve been reading the Bible for like…  17 years at this point, and hearing it since way before then. I know most of the stories by heart. D’ya wanna read it together? You can teach me piano, and I can teach you the gospel.” She turned towards him as though this question was truly a consideration, but Danny had already made up his mind.

“I’d love that.”

“Cool. I’ll get you a Bible. We’ll start next Sunday!”

--------------------------

Addie showed up to Danny’s room with a packet of sticky notes and a physical copy of the Bible. He didn’t understand why he couldn’t just get a copy of it on his phone, but when she peeled off the first sticky note he suddenly understood.

“Danny,” she said as she wrote his name on a neon-pink sticky note. She slapped it on the inside cover of the Bible and continued. “This is yours now!”

Danny’s face clearly displayed a level of confusion, so she clarified.

“I’m gonna make sure you _learn_,” She said with the attitude of a strict school teacher. “You might not take notes in class, but this is much more important to me than differential equations.”

“Okay okay, _ma’am_,” Danny replied, his voice positively dripping with sarcasm. “Whatever you say.”

“That’s right,” Addie said, ignoring his sass and moving on “Now, Genesis. Let’s begin.”

--------------------------

From then on, every week they’d meet up on Sunday after Addie returned from church. She’d give Danny a more digestible version of the sermon (“explain it like I’m stupid,” Danny would always say.) and then they’d begin to read. Starting from Genesis, Danny slowly but surely made his way through the Bible as they curled up in one of their rooms, sipping tea and reading. His Bible began to look like a rainbow, filled with color-coded notes in a mixture of his and Addie’s handwriting.

Every once and a while, their conversation would deviate from Bible-study into anything spiritual at all.

“I don’t understand fate,” Danny said one day in the middle of Jeremiah, “if God has plans to help us, why doesn’t he just force people to carry them out?”

“But if he makes you choose good, then you’re not really good anymore, are you?” Addie said, “I’ve asked this question before. I think it comes down to the fact that our humanity is in our ability to choose.” There was a beat of silence as Danny revealed what that question was really about.

“But he put you next to me in the library. I didn’t choose that," Danny said, “fate dictated _us._”

“But you chose to talk to me. That wasn’t fate.”

“I just think God sort of slammed the two of us together… it’s a _little_ unbelievable, right?”

“What, that God would present us with moments to choose our paths? Not really.”

“Well, when you say it like that…” Danny trailed off. Against his will, he felt words being carved into his skull again.

_Well, we both know that she’s wrong. God must’ve made this one happen, because there’s no way she’d like you otherwise_

--------------------------

_Those moments and so many more made me fall in love with you._

--------------------------

“What do you mean you don’t remember?” Danny asked with exasperation. Addie was sitting on his beanbag, head resting on her knees, thinking as hard as she could. She wasn’t _really_ paying attention when she hid the sticky notes around the room, so trying to deduce the location of the rogue sticky note was now a near-impossible task.

“I mean, you can tell what the message is right?” Danny looked down: … _are my favorite person in the whole wide world_.

Danny rolled his eyes. “No, Addie,” Addie raised an inquisitive eyebrow. Danny felt the need to defend himself: “What? This could be referring to anybody!”

Addie facepalmed, “who _else_ would I be referring to?”

“_I’ll never know if you don’t find the sticky note_, will I?”

“Well if you were better at finding them, we wouldn’t have this problem, would we?” Addie lifted her head up and tilted it at Danny accusingly.

“This… this is the meanest thing you’ve ever done to me.” Danny collapsed with mock indignation. “What a travesty.”

Addie scoured the room again, trying to retrace the steps she walked when she hid the sticky notes. “One under the sink… behind the computer… on the desk… I hid these like a week ago. How am I supposed to remember?”

“What? You did it _literally two hou-_ Oh forget it, we’ll just say I won the game and it’s fine.”

“Oh no, that’s not happening. I found all ten of yours,” Addie said as she leaned back onto the bed.

“Well, I would say this is considered a disqualification, since you ruined your _one job_. You’re paying for bubble tea tomorrow.” Danny suddenly had a positively evil idea. He hopped onto the bed and began crawling towards Addie. “Unless… you need to be convinced in another way.” Addie backed off in horror as she realized his intentions.

“No! I’ll pay. _I’ll pay!_” She cowered. There was a pause as Danny hovered menacingly on top of her. “... please don’t tickle me.”

“That’s what I thought.” Danny jumped off and barely heard as Addie whispered:

_“_Terrorist.”

“_What?_” Danny whipped back around and proceeded to unleash his wrath, tickling her until she was cry-laughing. “I’m putting these right here,” Danny said as he tucked it into the drawer beside his bed, “as a reminder that you, too, are sometimes a klutz.” Addie contorted her face and pretended like she was about to cry. Danny, hugging her close, proceeded to add, “but you’re _my_ klutz.”

Addie made gagging noises into Danny’s chest as Danny trapped her in his arms, cracking up.

--------------------------

_And I would’ve loved to think about those moments and nothing else — just you and me —..._

--------------------------

Addie gasped. Danny had completely transformed the little piano room. String lights dangled from the interlocking wooden beams above them. Danny had hung up a few posters of Frank Sinatra and Billy Joel. On a small table in the corner of the room, there were a few packets of green tea and a water boiler. It looked like something straight out of an Instagram post.

“It’s gorgeous,” Addie whispered as she hugged Danny. “The green tea is a nice touch.”

“I’m glad you like it,” Danny responded with a twinkle in his eye. “I wanted the room to look like it deserved someone as pretty as you.” Addie blushed and playfully shoved Danny away

“You’re the worst.” Danny laughed.

“I’ve been writing a song recently,” Danny said suddenly with childish excitement as he pulled out his laptop. “I’m a little stuck on the second verse.” He played the song for Addie, pausing before the second verse. “And see, now I don’t know what to do.”

“What if you added upbeat drums? Like… um… this?” She started tapping out a rhythm on the piano. Danny nodded along.

“You know what? That just might work!”

“And… I think maybe the second verse should go like this…” They spent the next few hours tossing lyrics and melodies back and forth.



A week later, Danny excitedly pulled the song up on his laptop. Addie was leaning on  him as he sat at the piano bench, peering over his shoulder with interest


## Play: Fall in Love Again

Danny pressed the spacebar after the song was done. “And that’s the song!”

“I love it!” Addie exclaimed.
