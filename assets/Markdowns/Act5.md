--------------------------

_But... I’m happy now, and I believe that one day you will be too. I don’t regret a single second that we spent together._

--------------------------

It was pouring outside when they returned. Add that to the below-freezing weather, and Daniel walked into his dorm building completely freezing and soaking wet. He trudged upstairs, slamming the door as he exited the stairwell.

Daniel collapsed backwards onto bed, staring at the ceiling. He didn’t even understand what he was feeling. Disgust? Sadness? It was all just so… exhausting. He closed his eyes, but he felt like Adelynn’s eyes were painted against his eyelids. Blue. So frustratingly, _disgustingly_ blue. No, no. Not quite. There were those little brown dots staining it. Gross. Like her. And her vomit-inducing perfume. Daniel felt like he just needed to cry. To sob. That would fix everything. But his eyes remained dry.

He stared at the ceiling, tracing the vents that lined the roof. He could feel as the rain in his hair slowly soaked into his sheets. He didn’t care. He kept drawing squares on the roof with his eyes, following the vents round and round.

Suddenly in the corner, he saw a little pink sliver. It was barely visible, since most of it was folded into the vent. He took off his socks and stood on his bed, reaching up. His ceilings weren’t high; he easily pulled it out. It was a sticky note, and Daniel knew immediately what it was.

He reached into his drawer and pulled out the other 9 sticky notes: _are my favorite person in the whole wide world_. He knew what would be written on this sticky note. He knew who wrote it. He knew who folded it, who snuck it into the vent, and who forgot it was in there.

He opened it.

_You_.


 “Fucking liar.” He whispered underneath his breath as he threw it onto the table. It landed right where it belonged and completed the message: You are my favorite person in the whole wide world. “Fucking. Liar.”


## _Play: Words Words Words_##

Daniel looked around his room. It felt like it was spiraling around him, collapsing on top of him, threatening to rip him apart and explode. The cocktail of frustration, depression, and regret forming in his stomach made him stumble. The ceiling folded in itself and Daniel’s knees grew weak from claustrophobia. He looked around for something, _anything_ that he could use to numb the pain until he saw it. The Bible.

Then, the words: _God lied_. Danny felt pure agony as those words etched themselves into his brain over and over again. _God lied. God lied. God lied. God lied._

Daniel clutched the Bible in his hands. He hadn’t quite finished it yet, and he could see little sticky notes jutting out in various places where Adelynn had introduced each of the stories to him. Daniel moved fast.

Wordlessly, he tore it in half. _God lied._ He grabbed pages out of the book and shredded them in a fit of pure rage. _God lied. _He clawed and ripped away at the cover. _God lied._ Still completely silent, he watched as neon sticky notes began to dot the floor like sprinkles amidst a Bible ice-cream cup. _God lied._ This one was in Adelynn’s handwriting. _God lied._ Those were Adelynn’s words. _God lied. _God said Adelynn was fate.

_God lied._

Genesis mixed with Revelations as each book of the Bible found itself mutilated on the floor. Daniel hoped that God on his almighty throne in heaven was hurting even half as much as Daniel was, watching his _precious book_ being torn apart. Was he in charge or not? Was he looking out for his children or not? What kind of sadistic, uncaring, unloving father would let their children cry and suffer without intervening? God, Fate, all words for the same gigantic lie: that there was a plan to his life.

Soon, Daniel ran out of steam, and his anger turned to a lethargy he’d never felt before. He curled up on the floor, clutching the near-empty Bible. The only pages left were from the book of Job. He thought back to Adelynn’s words. _Just read the Bible._

<sup><em>38 Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm. He said:</em></sup>

<sup><em>2</em></sup> _“Who is this that obscures my plans_

_with words without knowledge?_

<sup><em>3</em></sup> _Brace yourself like a man;_

_I will question you,_

_and you shall answer me._

<sup><em>4</em></sup> _“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?_

_Tell me, if you understand._

<sup><em>5</em></sup> _Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!_

_Who stretched a measuring line across it?_

<sup><em>6</em></sup> _On what were its footings set,_

_or who laid its cornerstone—_

<sup><em>7</em></sup> _while the morning stars sang together_

_and all the angels shouted for joy?_



Of course. God had a few more cosmic middle fingers to show him.

There was a sticky note on the page. Daniel ripped it off and read the words. _Despite this, God’s love is unfailing (Psalm 36:5)_. Adelynn’s handwriting. Daniel shivered. He felt a twisting sensation in his heart. Unfailing? Maybe for her. He had been stupid. Stupid for thinking God cared about him. Stupid for believing Adelynn when she said God had his best interests at heart. Stupid for… Daniel sighed. He sat on his chair, utterly dejected.

Suddenly, all of the tears that he hadn’t cried when Adelynn broke up with him came pouring out of his eyes. As the minutes passed, he didn’t move from his seat. Slowly, the tears subsided, and Danny opened his puffy and swollen eyes. He was equal parts devastated and confused.

He slowly picked himself up and got into the shower. Afterwards, he collapsed into his bed. All around his room lay the eviscerated pieces of the Bible.
