_When you said you understood and felt the same way, I didn’t question it. Maybe I should have._

--------------------------

The end was inevitable, but the words lingered unspoken in their throats.

Danny avoided speaking for as long as he could. He held Addie’s hands in his and they looked dead into each other’s eyes. For the first time, Danny realized that there were hazel specks in Addie’s eyes. After noticing it, her eyes seemed to lose the purity they had possessed for so long. Finally, she spoke.

“Yeah. No point in dragging it out,” Addie said, her voice lifeless, but unwavering. “It’s not working between us.” She blinked and Danny watched as a transparent tear trailed its way down her face. Danny wondered why he didn’t cry. He realized that he didn’t feel sad, just… hollow.

“I get it,” he said. “I just don’t want it to happen.”

“I don’t want it to happen either, but I think this is stopping both of us from growing.” Addie said, gesturing between the two of them. Danny turned to the right and laid on the floor. He hoped she would turn around and put her head on his chest, the way she always did before. Addie didn’t move.  

“We’ll still be friends?” Addie asked meekly. As soon as the question escaped from her lips, the answer came.

“Of course,” Danny replied reassuringly to the ceiling. “Why wouldn’t we be?” He didn’t even know why he asked the question; a million reasons flitted through his head instantaneously. It didn’t matter; Danny knew he was lying. How could he stay friends with her?

“Well. I suppose it’s settled.” Addie said, monotone. Danny really thought he’d have more to say, but as he traced the vents lining his ceiling, nothing entered his head but the prayer that he could disappear through those vents and get out of this room. Resigned, Danny nodded and the two of them stood up. “I’ll see you around, Danny,” Addie said as she left. Through the corner of his vision, he could see that she gave one last glance back, but Danny stared straight ahead and didn’t bother to look at her.

Danny’s heart crumbled. “Goodbye, Adelynn,” he said, completely devoid of emotion. He looked at her to see that there was a little bit of hurt in her eyes. He expected to feel warm about that, but instead he just continued to feel utterly, _utterly_ hollow. The door shut behind her.

The hours blurred into days blurred into weeks; Danny was convinced this didn’t change anything. He was single before and everything was fine. He threw himself into his schoolwork. In front of his friends, he was his same crazy self. They were all happier that he was spending more time with them instead of Adelynn. There was a fair amount of drinking and ‘no no, _she_ was the crazy one’; Danny was intent on finding some normalcy in his life.

At least the semester was just beginning, so there was a lot of work to do. Danny was grateful for the distraction. He flooded his professors with an influx of questions, and spent every available moment inside one office or another. His friends couldn’t understand why he was putting so much effort into school in his senior year; he even declined party invitations to meet with teachers.

The effort paid off… somewhat. In what seemed like the blink of an eye, a month went by as Danny sat in the passenger seat of his own life. He still didn’t feel sad. He just felt that continual emptiness. After a particularly hard test from Dr.Harvey’s bioengineering class (he had prayed that he wouldn’t have to spend another semester with him, but God apparently enjoyed watching Danny struggle), he trudged back to his dorm room. As he entered, he felt like all of the energy was suddenly drained out of him. It took all of his focus not to collapse on the floor.

_Worthless_.

He hadn’t felt this sensation in a while. Like ants swarming crumbs, self-loathing thoughts began running up the inside of his skull. Danny felt beads of sweat forming on his forehead. He sat on the floor and leaned against his bed. A churning sensation was beginning in his stomach, and he felt like he needed to throw up.

_She never loved you_.

Danny brought his arm to his forehead. He wasn’t sure he had a fever, but his head was definitely hotter than usual. He figured it was simply exhaustion, and climbed into bed.

_God lied._


## Play: Fantasy



--------------------------

_And last night… that was not how I intended for you to find out._

--------------------------

That was not how Danny found out.

Three weeks before ‘last night’, and about a month after he and Adelynn broke it off, he was in the library trying to study for his midterms. As he went to the café to grab his usual coffee, he spotted Adelynn making her way over to a table, followed closely by someone Danny didn’t know. They sat down, and Danny’s interest was piqued.

He figured he could do his reading in the café tonight. As he sat down at a table to begin, he couldn’t help but continually glance at the two silhouettes by the window. The crowded café seemed to fade away as the two of them spent the better part of half an hour just talking. Afterwards, they got up and left. Danny kept his nose buried into his laptop. Thankfully, he had chosen a seat far away from the door.

From then on, every time he went to work at the café, he’d look for Adelynn first. Every once in a while, the two of them would appear at that same seat in front of the window. Every time he saw them, Danny would feel something expand in his chest. It would start under his ribs and grow upwards until it plugged his esophagus. Thankfully, he was usually able to bring himself under control by reminding himself that he was in there with work to do.

Except, 2 and a half weeks later (3 days before ‘last night’), they left considerably earlier than they usually would. Danny was, again, in a corner booth, completely hidden to the outside world. But he was diligently focused on the two of them. Adelynn had pointed upwards before she left, and Danny had a sneaking suspicion as to what that meant.

He left the café, ensuring there were always about 3 groups of friends between him and Adelynn. Sure enough, he watched them turn the corner to the elevators. The feeling in his esophagus suddenly erupted and he felt like he was going to die of thirst. He turned into the bathrooms, practically inhaling the water from the water fountain. As soon as he stood up, he realized that the feeling hadn’t gone away. He felt extremely nauseous, but he was on a mission.

He walked over to the elevators and checked the numbers. One elevator was on its way up. 4...5...6. It stopped. Danny closed his eyes. He knew what they were doing. He considered just pretending he had never seen the two of them at the café. Perhaps he had simply been dreaming it up anyways.

Against his instincts, he called an elevator. He took it to the sixth floor, then walked into the stairwell. He hadn’t been up here since he and Adelynn broke it off. The room was… off limits. He took his time on the steps. Before he even creaked the door open, he knew. The sound of the old piano crooning reverberated weakly through the door. Adelynn was belting out Sinatra.

Danny closed the door quietly and, even though he tried not to, enjoyed the music.

“That was awesome. You’re so good at music! I can’t imagine playing the piano and singing at the same time.” A muffled male voice came resonating from the room. _That’d be him_. Danny looked through the window. He could vaguely see two silhouettes sitting on the piano bench. They were facing away from him, but there wasn’t a shadow of a doubt in Danny’s mind that they were sitting a little _too close_ to be friends.

“No no. I only started learning piano this past year. It’s just the chords for me,” said Adelynn with a laugh that sent butterflies straight into Danny’s stomach. He forced them away. _Are you going to tell him who taught you?_ Danny thought as he gritted his teeth.

“Well, you’ll have to teach me soon too. I’d love to be able to do that,” he said.

“Of course!”

Danny watched as the shadows on the wall leaned in. The light from the string lights above them seemed to grow brighter as he tried to peel his gaze away but couldn’t. He hung those string lights up. They leaned in. They kissed. Danny snuck back out of the room and headed back to his dorm, trying not to throw up. He entered his room and sat at his desk. He couldn’t comprehend what was happening to him. Surely, _surely_, Adelynn was just trying to make him jealous.


## 	Play: Better Than That

Danny breathed in and out, calming himself down. That’s right. This was a rebound relationship, headed for failure. They’d come back together in the end.

(last night)

--------------------------

Danny’s friends wanted to celebrate after midterms. They were thoroughly exhausted by their education, and were prepared to make a few questionable decisions to… _refresh_ themselves. Danny, eager for a distraction, agreed without hesitation.

“Where are we going?” Danny asked, after saying he’d go.

“Eclipse! It’s gonna be insane!” Danny’s heart sank. _Adelynn_. Then he hardened himself. _No. I will not let her ruin this._

“Alright. I’m in. Come pick me up at 8?” His friends agreed, then waved goodbye as they headed to their classes.

--------------------------

_Truthfully, I apologize if I hurt your feelings. If it helps, you hurt mine too.._

--------------------------

Danny was partying it up with his friends in a booth. They had bought enough drinks to keep them pacified for the night and they were steadily working their way through them while dancing.

“I wanna hear some noise from everyone who’s enjoying their night tonight!” The DJ was being obnoxious, but it was the right kind of obnoxious for this crowd. Danny joined in as the entire club howled. As he brought his beer up to his lips again, he paused.

Vanilla and honey. _No fucking way_. He slowly turned his head — Adelynn was standing right there. She looked directly at him and didn’t even bother to hide her obvious shock, but was dragged away by her friends before Danny could open his mouth.

His friends were pulling him to the dance floor, but Danny pulled away from them, pretending he needed to go outside for a breath of fresh air. They let him go and he beelined for Adelynn. Soon enough, he found her standing beside a few of her friends. She saw him as he approached; Danny could tell that her eyes were saying something, but he didn’t bother to decipher the message.

“So… fancy seeing you here again,” he said, awkwardly. He realized that he hadn’t really planned out what he was going to say.

“I could say the same to you,” she responded. Her eyes darted left and right. Danny had never seen her this squeamish, but he continued on as the unsaid words bottled up in his chest came spilling out.

“So I’ve heard you’ve found someone new.” Just vague enough to touch the subject, but not reveal the depth of his knowledge.

“Yeah,” she said without emotion, “We’re pretty happy. How about you?” She was obviously hoping he’d stay on the surface, respond ‘fine’ and leave.

“Honestly?” Danny was incredibly frank, “ Hurt. But I’ll be okay.”

“Danny—” Adelynn looked like there were a million things she wanted to say, but she was having trouble phrasing them. She finally settled on “I hurt too, you know?”

A couple of responses flitted across Danny’s head. Accusations that she never loved him, bitter remarks about how quickly she moved on… he tried to choose. He kept getting distracted by Adelynn’s obvious discomfort. Why did she keep glancing over his shoulder? He was about to turn around when his confusion was cleared up.

“Hey I brought you your drink— who’s this?” That was a familiar voice. He handed Adelynn her drink and looked expectantly at her.

“Hey… Will, this is Danny. A friend.” There was a subtle emphasis on friend, as if she was putting Danny in his place. _Well,_ Danny thought, _message received._

“Oh hey, Danny. Good to meet you,” he extended his hand and Danny shook his hand firmly. This was the hand. The hand that was touching her hand. The hand that held her the way he used to. It felt sweaty and disgusting and rough and uncomfortable and —

“Will. Nice to meet you too,” Danny responded plainly. The silence that befell them was entirely inappropriate for the atmosphere. The song on the speakers was thumping through its final chorus, and the three of them sat in an awkward triangle. Danny felt more and more like an intruder.“Well, I should go. Have a good night guys.”

“Thanks, Daniel,” Adelynn said, “have a good night.” Danny turned and saw a vindictive fire burning in her eyes.

He walked back to his friends as the next song started; Daniel grabbed another beer and chugged it all down. He screamed with his friends and danced.
