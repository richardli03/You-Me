Releasing an album soon with a story attached. Creating a website with better fundamentals to feature that story.

^ google has fonts you can use!

Problems:
I have a lot of text and I want to find a way to integrate it into my website without hard coding it.

TODO:
1. Finish writing the story
2. Figure out how Jekyll works and see if it could help me with my predicament.
3. Add buttons with various listening platforms integrated into the website
4. Maybe add a way to navigate to a specific song on the side
5. Design the landing page. How will it welcome users?

I'm so happy I didn't have to learn how to animate things.
