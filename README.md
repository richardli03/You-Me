Releasing an album 8/14 with a story attached. Created a website to display that story to the world!

I'm so happy I didn't have to learn how to animate things.

NOTE: I'm so sorry to anyone who has to read this code. I couldn't figure out how to get this website to read external .md files, so I ended up just hard coding it using atom's markdown --> html feature. A bit yikes, but we'll do better when I know how to code a bit more.
